Because of the Marine Corps, having a full-time job, and having babies though, it was difficult to achieve. Then, in order for me to be able to take full advantage of the GI Bill, I was required to take a certain amount of credits. It was too hard finding math courses offered at a time in which I could attend, so I decided to take some criminal justice courses to make up for those required credits, especially since I was working in the law enforcement field anyway. Long story short, I accidentally obtained my Criminal Justice Degree first. Then finally, five years and two kids later, I obtained my long-sought-after Math degree, as well as a minor in computer science.
