My husband works evenings and weekends and has Thursdays and Fridays off.  If we choose to send our\r\n            kids to public school, they won't get to see him very much.  Since we public school though, we are able\r\n                to arrange our school schedule in a way that better suits us as a family.  Our kids do schoolwork\r\n                Saturday through Wednesday and their schedule is as follows:</p>\r\n              <ul>\r\n                <li><b>8:00 - 11:00:</b> schoolwork (math, english, science, social studies, anatomy, sign language, spanish).</li>\r\n                <li><b>11:00 - 12:00:</b> weight lifting (Mon-chest, Tues-back, Wed-legs, Thurs-delts, Fri-arms and abs, Sat-legs)</li>\r\n                <li><b>12:00 - 13:00:</b> lunch</li>\r\n                <li><b>13:00 - 14:30:</b> schoolwork, or outside play if all their schoolwork is done</li>\r\n                <li><b>14:30 - 15:30:</b> cardio/reading (two days a week, one walks on the treadmill while the other reads out\r\n                loud to me for half an hour and then they switch; two days a week we do a boxing working for half an hour\r\n                and then they read quietly on their own for half an hour)</li>\r\n                <li><b>15:30 - 18:00:</b> outdoor play, kindle time</li>\r\n                <li><b>18:00</b> supper</li>\r\n                <li><b>20:00:</b> bedtime (usually a little bit of kindle time in bed and then I read to them for half an hour\r\n                before lights out by 21:00)</li>\r\n              </ul>\r\n              <p>For anyone interested, we get most of our books through a company called <a href=\"http://www.criticalthinking.com\" target=\"_blank\">Critical Thinking Company.</a></p>\r\n            </mdb-card-text>\r\n            </mdb-card-body>\r\n          </mdb-card>\r\n          </mdb-col>\r\n        </mdb-row>\r\n        <mdb-row v-if=\"view == 'recipes'\" class=\"m-t\">\r\n          <mdb-col col=\"12\">\r\n          <mdb-card class=\"mt-4 mx-4\" style=\"min-height: 400px\">\r\n            <mdb-card-header style=\"background-color: #F8E9A1; color: #24305E\">Recipe Book</mdb-card-header>\r\n            <mdb-card-body>\r\n            <mdb-card-title>Kid-friendly Recipes:</mdb-card-title>\r\n            <mdb-card-text style=\"font-size: 14px\">\r\n              <p><b>Tator Tot Hotdish</b></p>\r\n            <p>You will need:</p>\r\n            <ul>\r\n              <li>Tator Tots</li>\r\n              <li>Corn, 1 can</li>\r\n              <li>Beef, 1 pound</li>\r\n              <li>Cream of Chicken Soup, 1 can</li>\r\n            </ul>\r\n              <p>How to make:</p>\r\n              <ol>\r\n                <li>Start tator tots in the oven (follow instructions on package).</li>\r\n                <li>Brown beef over the stove-top in a pan.</li>\r\n                <li>Add soup, one soup can of milk, and corn to beef.</li>\r\n                <li>Bring to a boil</li>\r\n                <li>Lower the heat and let simmer until tator tots are done.</li>\r\n                <li>Once tator tots are done, pour meat mixture over tator tots and stir.</li>\r\n                <li>Place back in the over for five minutes.</li>\r\n                <li>Let cool.
